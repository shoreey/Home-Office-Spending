# Home Office Spending Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes Home Office spending data from April 2017 to March 2018. It showcases skills in dimensional modeling, SQL querying, and data visualization using Tableau and Power BI.

## Key Features
1. **Dimensional Modeling**: Implemented a star schema using Kimball methodology.
2. **SQL Analysis**: Performed complex analytical queries.
3. **Data Visualization**: Created interactive dashboards in Tableau and Power BI.

## Data Source
- 12 CSV files containing monthly spending data (April 2017 - March 2018)

## Methodology

### 1. Dimensional Modeling
- Designed a star schema with fact and dimension tables
- Ensured efficient querying and analysis capabilities

### 2. SQL Analysis
Executed various analytical queries including:
- Top three payment types and their quarterly totals
- Top four expense areas and their half-yearly totals
- Quarterly ranking of top 10 suppliers with rank changes

### 3. Data Visualization

#### Tableau Dashboard
- Interactive visualization of spending patterns
- Quarterly and annual trend analysis
- Supplier performance metrics



#### Power BI Dashboard
- Expense area breakdown
- Payment type distribution
- Top supplier analysis



## Technologies Used
- SQL (MySQL)
- Tableau
- Power BI


## How to Use
1. Set up the database using the provided schema
2. Run SQL queries for analysis
3. Open Tableau and Power BI files to interact with visualizations

## Future Work
- Incorporate more recent data for trend analysis
- Develop predictive models for future spending patterns
- Create an automated ETL pipeline for regular updates

This project demonstrates proficiency in data modeling, SQL analysis, and data visualization techniques, providing valuable insights into Home Office spending patterns.
